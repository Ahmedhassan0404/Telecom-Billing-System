           Telecom Billing System
__________________________________
Problem Statement:
In the rapidly growing telecom industry, efficient and accurate billing is essential to ensure customer satisfaction and revenue management. Traditional billing methods are often prone to errors, delays, and inefficiencies, leading to disputes and financial losses for telecom companies. This project aims to develop a Telecom Billing System that automates the billing process, ensuring accuracy, transparency, and real-time updates for both customers and service providers.

The system will handle customer subscriptions, generate bills based on usage, apply tariffs and discounts, and provide an easy-to-use interface for both administrators and end-users. By implementing this system, telecom companies can minimize errors, reduce operational costs, and improve overall customer experience.
